An MVC framework entirely in JavaScript. An ongoing investigation about the extreme use of JavaScript for mostly static websites that can be uploaded to a simple file server for easier and cheaper operation. Dynamic data can be retrieved from different domains if needed using JSONP or similar techniques.

Every view has its own isolated logic on a Java like class system (with parents and everything but in JavaScript obviously) were views are added, removed and replaced dynamically using the "this.view" property of the logic objects.
The framework also handles the use of different JavaScript libraries, asynchronous pre-fetching of images, loading of styles, translations and an internal cache system.
